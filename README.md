Network Analysis for Anti-Money Laundering in Python using NetworkX and gravis

Done Network Analysis using a publicly available dataset generated from IBM AMLSim. Did feature engineering to select and create features for effective analysis and visualization. Created Network as a Directed Graph using libraries like Pandas, NetworkX. Set various node and edge properties like degree, neighbours, groupÂ etc. for better visualization and syndicate tracking. Generated and visualized subgraphs starting with target groups or nodes for an end-to-end view. This is the most powerful use case in AML investigation which allows you to identify all related accounts from an end-to-end perspective, starting with any given node.
